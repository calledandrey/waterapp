<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although it is Water's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Water reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Water, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Water encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Water is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Water will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Water will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is Water's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Water does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Water is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

In no event will the Water parties be liable to you or anyone else for loss, damage or injury, including, without limitation, death or personal injury.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Water's request), indemnify and hold the Water Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Water's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents) or (2) violations of provisions 2.13 or 2.14 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Water (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Water, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Water hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Water will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Water is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Water or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Water can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Water in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Water's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Water reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.

Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
